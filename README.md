# UnityHelpers
Extensions and classes to ease development in Unity

Check the wiki for some help. It doesn't have all the help, just some.
Also, all helper methods are commented so the wiki doesn't explain each one.

Important!
When using this repository in your project, make sure to include any submodules. At the moment this repository has geometry3Sharp as a submodule. MIConvexHull was supposed to be a submodule, but it had some extra stuff I didn't want.
